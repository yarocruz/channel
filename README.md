# Channel

Channel is an RSS Reader Web App built with React. The project is currently in stage 0, but my aim is to make an RSS reader that has similar features like [Feedly](https://feedly.com/), Google Reader(RIP), and other popular RSS readers.

## What is RSS Even?

[RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) stands for Really Simple Syndication. It's a way for websites to put share their content online so RSS subscribers can get that content, specially new content, without the user having to visit the site directly. RSS was particularly popular during the "golden years" of blogging. 

## Why this project?

I miss the Web 2.0 days. I remember the first time I saw [Last.fm](https://www.last.fm/) in the early 2000s, and I miss Google Reader, Delicious, Digg before Reddit won that game... etc. My goal is to make an app that captures the spirit and aesthetics of those times. ðŸ™‚
